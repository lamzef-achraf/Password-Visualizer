# 🔐 Password Strength Checker

This is a simple web application that checks the strength of a password based on its length, use of numbers, uppercase/lowercase letters, and special characters.

## 🧠 What it does
- Tells you how strong your password is in real-time.
- Gives visual feedback (e.g., "Weak", "Medium", "Strong").
- Helps users create better, more secure passwords.

## 🛠 Built with
- *HTML* – to structure the page.
- *CSS* – to style the UI and strength indicator.
- *JavaScript* – to analyze the password and show the result instantly.

## 🧪 How it works
It checks for:
- Minimum length (usually 8+ characters)
- Presence of lowercase and uppercase letters
- Numbers
- Special symbols like @, #, !, etc.

Then it scores the password and displays the result as:
- ❌ Weak
- ⚠ Medium
- ✅ Strong

## 🎯 Why this project?
As a student learning web development, I created this project to practice JavaScript and improve user interaction on the front-end. It also helps raise awareness about password security.
